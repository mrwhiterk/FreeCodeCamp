        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>What you should already know</h3>
        </header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
            of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
          </li>

          <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Beginners tend to assume that because JavaScript has “Java” in its
          name they are somehow related. While most programmers groan at this
          coupling and many even feel that the name confusion is part of a
          marketing gimmick, the history of the two programming languages did
          intersect for a brief moment in time during the early days of
          Netscape. The evolution of the two languages took such wildly
          different paths from that point forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Javascript is interpreted language meaning that it parsed at runtime
          into binaries that your computer can understand. It is also
          dynamically typed meaning that checking the types of variables (if you
          added type checking) will happen during runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java is a compiled language meaning that it needs to be converted into
          binaries before the code can be executed. It is also statically typed
          meaning that it will check for types and error even before the code is
          executed.

        <header>
          <h3>Hello World</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          "Hello World" is typically the first "program" you make when learning
          a new programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can print "Hello World" to the console in JavaScript with:
          <br />
          <code>console.log('Hello World') // "Hello World"</code>
          <br />
          <code>console.log(typeof 'Hello World') // "string"</code>
        </p>
        <p></p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an
          unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example:
          <br />
          <code>var name = 'Ryan'</code>
          <br />
          Above, we are storing the string 'Ryan' in a variable we called
          'name'.
        </p>
        <p></p>

          <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript: var, let, const
        </p>
        <p>
          Example:
          <br />
          <code>var name = 'Ryan';</code>
          <br />
          Above, we are storing the string 'Ryan' in a variable we called
          'name'.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>let num = 5;</code>
          <br />
          Above, we are storing the number 5 in a variable we called 'num'.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <br />
          Above, we are storing the number 3.14 in a constant we called 'PI'.
          Note that constants are typically typed in all uppercase to remind the
          user that this value should not be changed.
        </p>
        <p></p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
        <header>
          <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          JavaScript has two scopes – global and local. Any variable declared
          outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore
          accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own
          scope, and any variable declared within that function is only
          accessible from that function and any nested functions.
        </p>

        Example:
        <br />
        <code>function doSomething () {</code>
        <br />
        <code>let name = 'Ryan';</code>
        <br />
        <code>}</code>
        <br />
        <code>doSomething()</code>
        <br />
        <code>console.log(name)</code>
        <br />
        <code>ReferenceError: name is not defined</code>
        <p>
          Above, we are creating a function and declaring a variable called name
          inside of it. After, we are invoking that function and then we try to
          print the name variable. However, received a Reference error because
          name is in a scope that you do not have access to globally.
